# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. The goal is to classify a review's sentiment as either positive or negative based on its text.

## Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to identify and extract subjective information from text.  In this project, we apply sentiment analysis to movie reviews, which can be useful for:

* **Understanding public opinion:** Gauging how audiences perceive a film.
* **Improving movie recommendations:** Providing more personalized suggestions.
* **Analyzing trends:** Identifying patterns in critical reception.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing:** Code for cleaning and preparing text data, including:
    * Removing HTML tags
    * Handling special characters
    * Converting to lowercase
    * Removing stop words
    * Stemming or lemmatization
* **Feature Extraction:** Techniques for converting text into numerical features, such as:
    * Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer)
    * TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
* **Model Training:** Implementation of machine learning models for sentiment classification, including (but not limited to):
    * Naive Bayes
    * Logistic Regression
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Deep Learning models (e.g., using RNNs or Transformers) (If applicable)
* **Evaluation:** Metrics and methods for evaluating model performance, such as:
    * Accuracy
    * Precision, Recall, F1-score
    * Confusion Matrix
    * ROC AUC (if applicable)
* **Dataset:** (Information about the dataset used)
    * If using a standard dataset (e.g., IMDB), provide a link and description.
    * If using a custom dataset, describe its source, structure, and any relevant details.
* **Results:** (Summary of the project's findings)
    * Report the performance of the best-performing model.
    * Discuss any interesting insights gained from the analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python (version X.X)
* [List of required Python libraries with versions] (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, tensorflow/pytorch)
    * Example:
        * `pip install pandas`
        * `pip install scikit-learn`
        * `pip install nltk`
        * `pip install tensorflow`  or  `pip install torch`

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nageshwarpatel7/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git](https://github.com/nageshwarpatel7/movie-review-sentiment-analysis.git)
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd movie-review-sentiment-analysis
    ```

3.  Install the required libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
    ```
    OR

    ```bash
    # Install libraries individually (if no requirements.txt)
    pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk ... # Add all the libraries
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    * If the dataset is not included, download it and place it in the appropriate directory.  Provide instructions on where to place the data.
    * Run the data preprocessing script:
        ```bash
        python data_preprocessing.py  # Or whatever the script name is
        ```

2.  **Model Training:**
    * Run the model training script:
        ```bash
        python train_model.py  # Or whatever the script name is
        ```
    * You might need to configure parameters (e.g., model type, hyperparameters) within the script.

3.  **Prediction:**
     * To predict the sentiment of new reviews:
        ```bash
        python predict_sentiment.py # or the relevant script
        ```

##  Further Improvements

* Experiment with different machine learning models and hyperparameter settings.
* Explore more advanced feature extraction techniques (e.g., word embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT).
* Incorporate techniques to handle imbalanced datasets (if applicable).
* Develop a user interface (e.g., a web application) for sentiment prediction.
* Add more comprehensive error handling and logging.
